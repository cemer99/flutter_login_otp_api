Login Application

## Getting Started

Request to API:
After receiving the user's email, the application makes a request to the API. This request includes the user's email address as a parameter.

Generating OTP:
The API generates a unique OTP for the provided email address. This OTP is a temporary and time-sensitive code that adds an extra layer of security.

Sending OTP:
The API sends the generated OTP to the user's email address.

User Interaction:
The user checks their email for the OTP and enters it into the mobile application.

OTP Verification:
The application sends the entered OTP back to the API for verification.

API Verification:
The API compares the received OTP with the generated OTP. If they match and the OTP is still valid within a certain time frame, the API confirms the authentication and allows the user to proceed.

Access Granted:
Once the API confirms the OTP's validity, the user is successfully authenticated and gains access to the application's features and functionalities.

Session Management:
The application may use session management techniques to keep the user logged in for a certain period without needing to re-enter the OTP.
